    " 1. Glean out non-intuitive insights<br>\n",

    " 3. Come up with intereseting metrics to determine team's and player's performance<br>\n",

    "* Why? - Most of the analysis that you see on the internet gives us a superficial view of what happened in the tournament therefore leaving many unusual trends hidden and questions unanswered. This analysis goes beyond such works and unlocks the hidden trends in order to help us understand the strategies and their impact.\n",

    "* Impact on sports and entertainment community:<br>\n",
    " 1. Helps football clubs make decisions based on the world cup performance of players.<br>\n",
    " 2. If built on a more comprehensive data set it can be used by teams to devise strategies based on the opponents.<br>\n",
    " 3. Can help football clubs save big on scouts and pick out players who aren't visible to naked eyes. <br>\n",
